# Record Library
The aim of this project is to create a record library.
I would like it to be able to do the following as a minimum:
* Keep a list of the records I own
* Keep three attributes per record; "Artist", "Title" and "Year" (referring to year of release)
* Print a list of owned records
* Add and remove records

Possible future additions include:
* Rating each record individually on a scale of 1 - 10
* The ability to search by each individual attribute
* More attributes - record label, featured artist, number of tracks(Track listing?)

## Why?
At time of writing (15/12/21) I am in week 3 of the Maker's Software Dev apprenticeship. This week's focus is on TDD and Debugging.
I feel like this project will allow me to practice and demonstrate each of these skills.

#### Task List
 [x] Setup initial repositories and add README
 [ ] Define the record class including attributes
 [ ] Define the library class
 [ ] Create methods for listing, adding and removing records
 [ ] \(Optional) Further tasksViktor_test
